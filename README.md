# AutoPurchase-Order
This C++ program automates the creation of a purchase order and quote. The user inputs the number of items they want to buy, and the program calculates the total cost (price per item is €12), assigns a random order number, and estimates a random delivery time (1–48 hours). The details are saved in an output file and displayed to the user.
