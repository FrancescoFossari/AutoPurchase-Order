# Order Quote Automation - C++ Project

This is a simple C++ program that automates the creation of purchase orders and quotes for a simulated customer transaction. The program was designed as a quick project to practice programming concepts and pass the time, with plans for future expansions and improvements.

## **Features**
- Prompts the user to input the number of items they want to purchase.
- Calculates the total cost based on a fixed price of â‚¬12 per item.
- Generates a random order number for the customer.
- Estimates a random delivery time between 1 and 48 hours.
- Outputs the order details, including the order number, total cost, and delivery time, into a text file (`out.txt`).
- Displays essential order details to the user in the console.

## **How It Works**
1. **User Input:** The program asks the user to input the number of items they wish to buy.
2. **Order Calculation:** Based on the input, it calculates the total price and assigns a random order number and delivery time.
3. **File Output:** The generated order details are written to a file called `out.txt`.
4. **Console Output:** Key details of the order are also displayed in the terminal for immediate feedback.

## **Planned Improvements**
Since this project was created quickly to explore programming and have fun, there are many potential enhancements for the future:
- **Error Handling:** Improve input validation and error messages.
- **User Menu:** Add a menu for managing multiple orders or viewing past orders.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Allow different prices per item or discounts for bulk purchases.
- **Data Persistence:** Save orders to a database for long-term storage.
- **Interface:** Implement a graphical or web-based interface for a better user experience.
- **Language:** Improve more languages , at the moment the interface is in italian language.

## **Usage**
To run this program:
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Follow the prompts to input the number of items.
4. Check the `out.txt` file for your detailed order summary.

This is a simple project, but I plan to develop it further with new features and optimizations. Stay tuned for updates! ðŸ˜Š
